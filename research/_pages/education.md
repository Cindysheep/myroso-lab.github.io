## Educational robots

![](../images/research-education.jpg)

Robotics is now one of a few technologies that have the potential to have an impact over the next few decades similar to the one that the Internet has today. One of the main reasons is that new robotics applications are extending the role of robots beyond jobs that humans do not want or cannot do to socially assistive scenarios that aim to help people in more personal ways and provide not only physical, but also social support. In this context, we investigate how robots can be used as educational agents to support studentsâ€™ learning. In addition to the technological advancements required to achieve this objective, we are interested in how robots can be used as a support for teachers in a classroom environment and how they can be integrated in the design of new engaging scenarios for learning.

## User modelling for personalised and co-adaptive human-robot interaction

![](../images/research-modeling.jpg)

Simulating the tremendous social adaptation abilities that characterise human interactions requires the establishment of bidirectional processes in which humans and robots synchronise and adapt to each other in real-time by means of a mutual exchange of verbal and non-verbal behaviours in order to achieve mutual co-adaptation. The ability to respond in a contingent manner to users’ needs, preferences, interests, intentions and emotions is, in fact, of paramount importance to achieve long-term robot autonomy, that is, to establish and maintain autonomous interactions with human users over extended periods of time. To endow robots with co-adaptation abilities, a typical approach leverages statistical learning to incrementally adapt robot’s behaviours and strategies to a specific user’s situation, for example, a user’s emotion, personality or progress with a task. This affect-based, personalised co-adaptation aims to close the human-machine loop while enabling robot learning from human users in more natural, intuitive ways.

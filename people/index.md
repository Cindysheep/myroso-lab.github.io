### Ginevra Castellano

<span style="color:grey"> Associate Professor </span>

<span style="color:grey"> Lab Director </span>

Ginevra Castellano is an Associate Professor at the Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, where she leads the Social Robotics Lab. Her research interests are in the areas of social robotics and affective computing, and include social learning, personalized adaptive robots, multimodal behaviours and uncanny valley effect in robots and virtual agents. Over the last ten years she has been working on the development of computational abilities that allow robots to behave in a socially intelligent way in scenarios where robots provide social support to humans, for example as tutors in the classroom or as companions for children.

Maike Paetzel is a PhD student in the Social Robotics Lab and mainly focused on studying the uncanny valley effect. She is specifically interested in how interactions with an agent can change an initial (uncanny) perception. Maike’s background is both in humanoid robotics and conversational agents. Apart from Human-Robot Interaction her heart belongs to the RoboCup community, where she is still actively engaged in the team Hamburg Bit-Bots and the organization of the Humanoid League.

Alex Yuan Gao is a Ph.D. candidate, who wants to live in a world filled with innovative businesses, robots, books that come bundled with extra hot chocolate and a steampunk-styled force field around his keyboard that repels cats. He is interested in machine learning, as applied to (social) robotics. In particular, he is interested in deep/reinforcement/neuro-based learning approaches to robotic perception, control, and physical modeling of the robot's environment. Currently, he is working on projects that can fill the gap between deep reinforcement learning and social robotics.

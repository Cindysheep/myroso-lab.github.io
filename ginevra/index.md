I am a Professor in Intelligent Interactive Systems at the Department of Information Technology of Uppsala University, Sweden, where I lead the Uppsala Social Robotics Lab.
My research interests are in the area of intelligent interactive systems, and include social robotics, human-robot interaction and affective computing. By adopting an interdisciplinary approach grounded in principles from the social sciences, I aim to develop computational social abilities that allow robots to behave in a socially intelligent way in natural interaction with humans. 
The natural testbed for my research are socially assistive scenarios where robots provide not only physical, but also social support to humans, where robotic technologies have the potential to bring benefits to the society we live in, for example in application areas such as education and assistive technology, by enhancing the lives of children and other groups that require specialised support and intervention.

From 2012 to 2016 I was the coordinator of the EMOTE project, which developed educational robots to support teachers in a classroom environment.

I am now the recipient of a starting grant from the Swedish Research Council (VR) in the area of personalised instructional robots (2016-2020).

I am also PI for Uppsala University of a framework grant (COIN) on the topic of co-adaptive human-robot interactive systems (2016-2021), funded by the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF), in collaboration with KTH Stockholm, and of the H2020 Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie ITN project ANIMATAS on human-machine interaction with human-like social capabilities for education in schools (2018-2021).

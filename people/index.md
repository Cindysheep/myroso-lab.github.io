    <div style="font-size:.8em"> (Alex) Yuan Gao is a former PhD student in the Social Robotics Lab at Uppsala University. His research interests are driven by a final goal of developing AI-driven robots that can think and feel like real humans (e.g. Ex Machina). This encircles robot's learning and control, nature language processing, image processing, neuroscience and computational phycology. In particular, he is interested in deep/reinforcement/neuro-based learning approaches to robotic perception, control, and physical modeling of the robot’s environment, which can help us to understand ourselves and build a unified learning structure for adaptive, efficient and robust complex robotic system. Currently, he is working on projects that can fill the gap between deep reinforcement learning and social robotics.</div>
